  This PR bumps js-yaml from 3.x to 4.x in accordance with its migration guide. This bump means that we're able to use the default safe behaviour for both exports and imports.

  Notably, this means that we won't end up with values like !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/undefined> '' that are not at all human friendly and were problematic when we used the .safeLoad functionality.
