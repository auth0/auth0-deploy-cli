function create(user, callback) {
  // This script should create a user entry in your existing database. It will
  // be executed when a user attempts to sign up, or when a user is created
  // through the Auth0 dashboard or API.
  // When this script has finished executing, the Login script will be
  // executed immediately afterwards, to verify that the user was created
  // successfully.
  //
  // The user object will always contain the following properties:
  // * email: the user's email
  // * password: the password entered by the user, in plain text
  // * tenant: the name of this Auth0 account
  // * client_id: the client ID of the application where the user signed up, or
  //              API key if created through the API or Auth0 dashboard
  // * connection: the name of this database connection
  //
  // There are three ways this script can finish:
  // 1. A user was successfully created
  //     callback(null);
  // 2. This user already exists in your database
  //     callback(new ValidationError("user_exists", "my error message"));
  // 3. Something went wrong while trying to reach your database
  //     callback(new Error("my error message"));
